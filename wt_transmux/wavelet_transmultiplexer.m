%% Three-Channel Wavelet Transmultiplexer
% This example shows how to reconstruct three independent combined signals
% transmitted over a single communications link using a Wavelet
% Transmultiplexer (WTM). The example illustrates the perfect
% reconstruction property of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

%% Introduction
% This WTM combines three source signals for transmission over a single
% link, then separates the three signals at the receiving end of the
% channel. The example demonstrates a three-channel transmultiplexer, but
% the method can be extended to an arbitrary number of channels.
%
% The operation of a WTM is analogous to a frequency-domain multiplexer
% (FDM) in several respects. In an FDM, baseband input signals are filtered
% and modulated into adjacent frequency bands, summed together, then
% transmitted over a single link. On the receiving end, the transmitted
% signal is filtered to separate adjacent frequency channels, and the
% signals are demodulated back to baseband. The filters also must strongly
% attenuate the adjacent signal to provide a sharp transition from the
% filter passband to its stopband. This step limits the amount of
% crosstalk, or signal leakage, from one frequency band to the next. In
% addition, FDM often employs an unused frequency band between the three
% modulated frequency bands, known as a guard band, to relax the
% requirements on the FDM filters.
%
% In a WTM, the filtering performed by the synthesis and analysis wavelet
% filters is analogous to the filtering steps in the FDM, and the
% interpolation in the synthesis stage is equivalent to frequency
% modulation. From a frequency domain perspective, the wavelet filters are
% fairly poor spectral filters as compared to the filters required by a FDM
% implementation, exhibiting slow transitions from passband to stopband,
% and providing significant distortion in their response. What makes the
% WTM special is that the analysis and synthesis filters together
% completely cancel the filter distortions and signal aliasing, producing
% perfect reconstruction of the input signals and thus perfect extraction
% of the multiplexed inputs. Ideal spectral efficiency can be achieved,
% since no guard band is required. Practical limitations in the
% implementation of channel filters create out-of-band leakage and
% distortion. In the conventional FDM approach, each channel within the
% same communications system requires its own filter and is susceptible to
% crosstalk from neighboring channels. With the WTM method, only a single
% bandpass filter is required for the entire communications channel, while
% channel-to-channel interference is eliminated.
%
% Note that a noisy link can cause imperfect reconstruction of the input
% signals, and the effects of channel noise and other impairments in the
% recovered signals can differ in FDM and WTM. This can be modeled, for
% example, by adding a noise source to the data link.
